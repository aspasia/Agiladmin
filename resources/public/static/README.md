# Welcome to Agiladmin!

This software is a tool to implement an agile workflow in project
administration, management and budgeting. It is based on Excel and Git.

## Timesheets

Each colleague can fill in a timesheet file and commit updates to it
to a Git repository. The timesheet is a normal excel sheet divided by
columns with a few fixed fiels (project, task and tags)

## Log of changes

Agiladmin logs all changes on the Git repository pulling updates
directly from it, then processes the information found in the
timesheet to visualise it in different ways.

## Commit changes to budgets

Agiladmin is capable of writing all the hours read from the timesheets
into a special tab of budget files that are related to projects. This
way an up-to-date overview of currently used hours and hours and money
left in the project budget is available to all users.
