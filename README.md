[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dyne/Agiladmin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dyne/Agiladmin)


A cross-platform application that offers an integrated environment for
the administration of human-resources in small and medium
organisations and enterprises.

Agiladmin is an ideal tool for startups and research organisations, it
is used internally at Dyne.org to document working hours, calculate
budgets and pay co-workers based on monthly efforts.

Agiladmin accepts and renders Excel files to ease the integration with
the workflow of expert financial admins without disrupting their
tooling. It adopts Git as a backend to synchronise the collection of
timesheets and leverages the power of Clojure in data-centric
applications to allow easy generation and customisation of graphics
and reports related to personnel and projects.

Agiladmin should be considered software in ALPHA stage and for now is
only used internally at Dyne.org to manage research projects according
to the EU Horizon 2020 financial guidelines. Users should consider
this a technological preview and Dyne.org staff may or may not be able
to help adopting this software at this stage. We are working on more
documentation and once in BETA stage we will offer training and
support.
